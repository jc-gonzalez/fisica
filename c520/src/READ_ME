The CORSIKA520 set consists of 26 files:

* a file READ_ME giving these short instructions how to proceed,
* a postscript file CORSIKA_GUIDE520.ps,
      (The file CORSIKA_GUIDE520.dvi contains it in dvi-mode.),
* the major part of the source code (CORSIKA520.car) which is a CMZ 
      card file, that contains the code of CORSIKA without GHEISHA ,
      VENUS, SIBYLL, QGSJET, and DPMJET,
* 7 separate files with the pure FORTRAN code of the GHEISHA, VENUS,
      SIBYLL, QGSJET, and DPMJET routines, respectively (GHEISHA.f, 
      VENUS.f, SIBYLL.f, QGSJET.f, DPMJET1.f, DPMJET2.f, DPMJET3.f),
* 5 data sets containing the energy dependent cross sections for 
      nucleon-nucleus processes (NUCNUCCS), electromagnetic inter-
      actions (EGSDAT2), and numerical data to be used by the VENUS 
      routines (VENUSDAT) and by the DPMJET routines (DPMSTRUC and
      GLAUBTAR),
* 9 datasets with atmospheric data for various large inclination 
      angles (ATMxx),
* an example input (INPUTS) to steer the simulation, and
* a brief description of the changes in the program since the first 
      CORSIKA version in the file CORSIKA_HISTORY.

The CORSIKA code and the files belonging to it can be obtained from 
FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM KARLSRUHE by anonymous ftp. If you want to transfer 
CORSIKA files to your computer system, you have, for instance, to type 
the following (commands that you have to type are underlined):

All files are text files annd should be transferred with the ASCII 
option.  For faster transmission you may take the 'gzip' compressed 
files, which you find in the subdirectory pub/corsika/v520/gzipfiles. 
Before using those files, you first have to decompress the files 
applying the gunzip procedure.

P.S. A recent detected error has been corrected in GHEISHA.f. Therefore
this corrected GHEISHA.f differs from the Gheisha used together with former
versions of Corsika.   D.H.
