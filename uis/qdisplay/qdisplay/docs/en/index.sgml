<sect1>How to obtain Qdisplay
<p>

You can get the last release of Qdisplay from the author's site,
<htmlurl url="http://www.gae.ucm.es/~gonzalez"
name="www.gae.ucm.es/~gonzalez">.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>

You need the following libraries/programs installed (or merely compiled,
at least) on your system to be able to compile, link and run Qdisplay.

<itemize>
<item> Qt libraries, the Troll Tech's cross-platform C++ GUI application
       framework (look at the <htmlurl url="www.trolltech.com"
       name="Troll Tech Homepage">).

       Qdisplay was originally developed using Qt 1.4x, but in the last
       times it was moved to Qt 2.2.0. You've been warned.

<item> The Qwt Widget library, with widgets useful for technical and
       scientifical purposes. Released under the GNU license.
       Copyright (C) 1997 Josef Wilgen.

<item> GNU make

<item> Hmmm... err... I do not know what else, but I think that was all.
</itemize>

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install Qdisplay on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Qdisplay distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Since Qdisplay uses <verb>autoconf</verb> you should have not trouble
compiling it.

The Qwt library is not shipped with Qdisplay. Therefore, be sure that
your library is installed in your system. If you get any compiler or linker
error, be sure that:

<itemize>
<item> Your header files are available, usually under the path
       <verb>/usr/local/include/qwt</verb>

<item> Your libraries are locate in a pre-configured path for
       dynamic linking (in my system the directory <verb>/usr/local/lib</verb>
       does the job). If not, modify the apropriate files in your system (usually
       /etc/ld.so.conf), adding the directory where the library is located,
       and don't forget to run 'ldconfig' if necessary.

<item> Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable contains the directory
   where libqwt.* can be found. Examples:

   <itemize>
   <item> sh, bash, zsh:
<tscreen><verb>
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:your_libqwt_dir
</verb></tscreen>
   	
  <item> csh, tcsh:
<tscreen><verb>
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:your_libqwt_dir
</verb></tscreen>
  </itemize>
</itemize>
