This package still uses HBOOK (from the CERNLIB library) for
its banking data output. There is a version in preparation for
using ROOT as native output format.

Since the last version 1.0 there has been minor improvements. 
Nevertheless, they are a lot. I have really not time to write it 
down here now, but one of these days I will try to write a full 
documented list of the changes, upgrades, ...

May be some others should do it. May be some others are doing 
it now. Good luck!
