Copyright (C) 1998, 1999 J.C.Gonzalez <gonzalez@mppmu.mpg.de>
======================================================================

This is the README file from the distribution of the program 
camera v1.1.

Please read the files NOTE, NEWS and TO-DO. 

In principle, you should not have big problems to compile this
program. If you have all you need, you just have to write 

# make depend

and then

# make

and that's it.

REQUIREMENTS
=============

  - You will need the set of files in the package
    'includes-1.1.tar.gz'.

  - You will need the package 'reflector-1.1.tar.gz'.

  - For the generation of the documentation out of the source code,
    you will need the package 'sus-1.0.tar.gz'

  - The CERN libraries (for the moment)

  - The library RANLIB.C (RANLIB for C). RANLIB.C can be obtained from
    statlib.  Send mail whose message is 'send ranlib.c.shar from
    general' to statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu. RANLIB.C can also be
    obtained by anonymous ftp to odin.mda.uth.tmc.edu (129.106.3.17)
    where is is available as /pub/unix/ranlib.c.tar.Z . 

The suggested structure for the different directories, corresponding
to these packages, is the following:

        detector
           |---- reflector
           |---- camera
           |---- data
           |---- include
           |---- include-COR
           |---- include-MC
           `---- include-util

This is the structure used when building the source.


DOCUMENTATION
==============

The documentation is still missing. Moreover, the available
documentation extracted from the code is still imcomplete. Don't
hesitate to contact the author for any doubt, but you should not
expect, generally speaking, any kind of offline or online support.

This piece of code comply with the SuS v0.52 system of source code
self-documentation (you can find a copy of this document at
http://hegra1.mppmu.mpg.de:8000/~gonzalez/cdoc/susdoc/susdoc.html).
But it *does not* comply (yet) with the recommendations given in the
document "Recommendations on writing self-documented source code" (you
can find a copy of this document or browse it online at
http://hegra1.mppmu.mpg.de:8000/~gonzalez/cdoc.html)


COMPILATION
============

Read the file INSTALL for information about compiling the code.


RUNNING THE PROGRAM
====================

In order to run the program you will need a parameters file. Then, you
can do either:

# camera < input.cpar

or 

# camera -@ input.cpar

See the file input.cpar for an example of parameters file.


FEATURES
=========

The following is a non-exhaustive list of features of camera v1.1: 

o  Reads as input files *both* .rfl files (from reflector 1.x) and
   .phe files (from camera itself), produced in previous runs of
   camera.

o  Produces as output files the following files:

   - A .phe file (binary format) with information about the 
     images produces in the camera.

   - A .dat file (ASCII format) with more or less the same
     information.

   - A .hbook files (HBOOK, machine-independent binary format) with
     information about the images obtained.

   - Text output in the terminal.

   - There is a primitive attempt of producing ASCII files with 
     information about the timing of the Cherenkov photons in the
     detection devices.

o  Simulation of the NSB (can be disabled).

o  Simulation of trigger logic (can be disabled).

o  Simulation of tail-cut conditions (can be disabled).

o  Image analysis using standard Hillas parameters, and others.

o  Analysis of islands structure of the image.

o  Possibility of reading data from disk files or from standard input.

o  Possibility of writing output data to disk file or to standard output.

o  Possibility of reading parameters from standard input or from
   file selected in the command line through the command line option
   '-@'

o  Selection of different random numbers seeds

o  Possibility of selecting an energy range for the input showers.

o  Possibility of skipping pre-selected showers.

o  Possibility of writing to output *all* the showers, no matter the
   trigger condition imposed.
