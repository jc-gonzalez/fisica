Important note
===============

Please, note that this code is *not longer* supported
by its author, is the sense that although new releases 
could come, with more updates and probably even more 
features, generally speaking you should not expect them.

You can of course contact the author for questions. But 
we are all very busy with out own bussiness. Therefore  
although it can be just a matter of time for you to get 
feedback from your questions, you should not expect any 
kind of offline or online support.
