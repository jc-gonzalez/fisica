Installation
=============

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and
     edit the file 'config.mk'. Change there anything you need.

  2. Type `make depend' to calculate dependencies.

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. You can remove the object files from the source code directory by
     typing `make clean'. 

  5. If you want to recompile everything, you can do it typing
     'make redo'

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
=====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at
the same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in
their own directory. 

   If you manage to compile this program after making a small or severe
change into, for example, the 'Makefile', you are strongly encouraged
to contact the author, in order to add your modifications in a
(possible) next release.
